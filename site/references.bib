@article{Hedges2014,
abstract = {Jazz music is a genre that consists mainly of improvising over known tunes, represented as a lead sheet. This study addresses the question 'to what extent does a lead sheet carry information about its composer?' Primarily, this study considers chord progressions alone, and secondarily melodic and temporal in-formation combined with various multiple viewpoint models. Using these classifiers, a novel subsequence selection algo-rithm is presented to trace stylistic similarities within a lead sheet. We conclude that composers can, to a reasonable extent, be recognized from their chord progressions, and that the consideration of melodic and temporal information improves classification accuracy by a small but statistically significant amount.},

@article{Broze2013,
abstract = {The present study examines both gradual and rapid changes occurring in 20th-century jazz harmonic practice. A newly-assembled corpus of 1,086 jazz compositions was used to test the idea that jazz music exhibits a mid-century decline in traditionally “tonal” chord usage. Evidence was found for slow, incremental changes in zeroth-order chord quality distributions, consistent with gradual, unconscious changes in harmonic usage. Typical tonal chord-to-chord transitions became less common between the 1920s and the 1960s, consistent with the hypothesis of tonal decline. Finally, use of root motion of an ascending perfect fourth dropped suddenly in the 1950s, suggesting that chord-to-chord transitions might be more susceptible to rapid change than chord frequency. Possible constraints on stylistic evolution are discussed.},

@article{Gauvin2015,
abstract = {The goal of this research is to investigate the pitch structures of popular music in the 1960s through a large corpus study in order to identify any consistent changes in harmonic and tonal syntax. More specifically, two studies based on the Billboard DataSet (Burgoyne, Wild {\&} Fujinaga, 2011; Burgoyne, 2011), a new corpus presenting transcriptions for more than 700 songs, are presented. The first study looks at the incidence of multi-tonic songs throughout the decade, while the second study focuses on the incidence of flat-side harmonies (e.g. bIII, bVI, and bVII) over the same period of time. While no difference was observed in the frequency of multi-tonic songs, the study showed a significant increase in the incidence of flat-side harmonies during the second half of the decade.},

@inproceedings{Mauch2010,
abstract = {The automatic detection and transcription of musical chords from audio is an established music computing task. The choice of chord profiles and higher-level time-series modelling have received a lot of attention, resulting in methods with an overall performance of more than 70{\%} in the MIREX Chord Detection task 2009. Research on the front end of chord transcription algorithms has often concentrated on finding good chord templates to fit the chroma features. In this paper we reverse this approach and seek to find chroma features that are more suitable for usage in a musically-motivated model. We do so by performing a prior approximate transcription using an existing technique to solve non-negative least squares problems (NNLS). The resulting NNLS chroma features are tested by using them as an input to an existing state-of-the-art high-level model for chord transcription. We achieve very good results of 80{\%} accuracy using the song collection and metric of the 2009 MIREX Chord Detection tasks. This is a significant increase over the top result (74{\%}) inMIREX2009. The nature of some chords makes their identification particularly susceptible to confusion between fundamental frequency and partials. We show that the recognition of these diffcult chords in particular is substantially improved by the prior approximate transcription using NNLS.},
