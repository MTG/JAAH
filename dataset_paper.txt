      * Convert annotations

         * chords
         * style, rhythmic feel, tonality type (how they devised these taxonomies?!)
   * Move references to audio from annotation jsons to special file,

         * ? style, genre, rhythmic feel and tonality type (? jazzomat compatible taxonomy)
         * (?) Discuss: add tonal centers/local tonality to the annotation
         * put all information to JSON (eliminate csv file(s)).
      * Think, if more titles could be added without significant efforts
        in order to annotate everything from Smithsonian until certain year.
        Thus we will not introduce bias to the balanced dataset
        and could present it as source of musicological information about jazz “until certain year”.
      * Discuss anf implements guidelines to segmentation.
        What should be a smallest segmentation element? So far: chorus (?may be use parts - e.g. A1, A2,...)
        Are there any part taxonomy (e.g. "intro", "break")?.

Paper.


0. Title

1. Abstract
From "Billboard"

Audio chord recognition has attracted much interest in recent years,
but a severe lack of reliable training data—both in terms of quantity and range of
 sampling—has hindered progress. Working with a team of trained jazz musicians,
  we have collected time-aligned transcriptions of the harmony in more than a
  thousand songs selected randomly from the Billboard “Hot 100” chart
   in the United States between 1958 and 1991.
   These transcriptions contain complete information about upper extensions and
   alterations as well as information about meter, phrase, and larger musical
   structure. We expect that these transcriptions will enable significant advances in
    the quality of training for audio-chord-recognition algorithms, and furthermore,
     because of an innovative sampling methodology, the data are usable as they stand
      for computational musicology. The paper includes some summary figures and
       statistics to help readers understand the scope of the data as well
        as information for obtaining the transcriptions for their own research.

2. Introduction

 TODO: BACKGROUND.
Problem: MIR: mainly pop and rock music, jazz data is few.
Problem: Jazz research: fragments (solo, chorus), no relation to audio.
Problem: selection/bias.
Problem: transcription methodology

TODO: Aspect: why the jazz is interesting?
why jazz is specific? Why harmony in jazz is important?
TODO: Aspects/keywords: jazz education, established jazz styles, jazz scholars, chord transcription

    Our paper introduces a dataset with annotations
of jazz audio recordings which aimed to fill the mentioned gaps.

TODO: EMPHASIZE NOVELTY!!!
The reason for creating a new dataset is twofold.
First, provide MIR community with the new source for content-based analysis,
in particular for training and evaluating chord transcription and structure segmentation algorithms.
Second, provide new dataseta to jazz researchers.

Novelty:  contains not only leadsheet-style
          symbolic information but features extracted from audio.
Novelty: full track information
Novelty: jazz

We start with reviewing publicly available data sets related to jazz and to
chords transcription in general.
Based on preceding analysis we justify necessity of the new dataset and the new format.
Then we describe annotation structure and methodology. Finally
we demonstrate it's application for chord estimation algorithms evaluation
and to computer-aided harmony analysis and visualization.
All code used for dataset processing is openly available at TODO.

3. RELATED WORK.

    Review related datasets and formats:
       I. chord-annotated audio datasets
       II. jazz-related datasets
       III. annotation formats (introduce JAMS)
    Aspects to review:
        - content selection principle
          E.g. from [Humphrey, E. J., & Bello, J. (2015). Four Timely Insights on Automatic Chord Estimation. Retrieved from https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/four-timely-insights-on-automatic-chord-estimation]
          "chords may not be a valid way to describe all kinds of music"
          therefore we select jazz styles where chords are important
          (as both: expression method and contract)
        - annotation guidelines/methodology
        - format
        - what is intended/used for (e.g. chord recognition systems training/testing,
          corpus-based methodology).
    Aspects (more formal):
       * URL
       * paper/reference
       * genre/representativeness. How tracks were selected.
       * Annotation methodology. How labels were assigned.
       * content (e.g., beats, chords, keys, segmentation...)
       * format
       * usages (MIR chord detection, corpus based research)
       * open audio (no)

5. PROPOSED DATASET
   TODO: Aspect: chord transcription vs. chord estimation

   ? Why another one dataset:aspects?
   ? Why another one format: format description?
   format description
   data (smithsonian and other description)
   MusicBrainz: we edit data on music brainz,....
   NOTE: chord notation semantics (use ISMIR format, but different meaning).
   Unordered aspects:
       * selection (why Smithsonian)
       * ??? failed to have open audio dataset.
         ??? should we include "in search of 'open source' jazz" notes? at least prepare
       * transcription methodology
         (beat tracking, using sources, using visual clues from NNLS chroma,
         background track generation).
         ... accompanying by chroma features and visualization.
