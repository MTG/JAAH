-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODOs (for each delivery entity):
   * write a paper :)
   * Website dataset presentation:
      * Fix style/plots glitches
      * Write glossary with terms and pictures explanation
      * "Index page":
         * Aggregates for dataset
            * duration
            * number of tracks
            * number of beats
            * number of chord segments
            * average harmonic rhythm
            * Chord type quantity/duration
            * Chord type chroma distribution (hexagrams)
            * Histogram by year
            * Histogram by genre
            * Histogram by harmonic rhythm
            * Histogram by rhythm feel
            * top 2-grams
            * top N-grams
            * Hexagrams/violin plots (chroma distribution) for each chord type (?)
      * for each track
         * POSTPONE: Nicely presented annotation (e.g. pdf leadsheet).
           So far could provide nicely formatted JSON.
      * Annotate writer/composer and line-up on musicbrainz.
   * Format and annotation improvements
      * annotation start/end (check: may be it works right now?)
      * Try to embed it into JAMS
         * https://github.com/marl/jams
         * Humphrey, E. J., Salamon, J., Nieto, O., Forsyth, J., Bittner, R. M., & Bello, J. P. (2014).
           Jams: a Json Annotated Music Specification for Reproducible Mir Research.
           In Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR).
      * separate beats and make it fully JAMS compatible
      * introduce pickup/incomplete bar
      * add attributes:
         * ? context/source: Smithsonian Antology/Smith. Collection/Jazzomat/other
           (multiple values could be assigned).
         * annotator
         * ? style, genre, rhythmic feel and tonality type (? jazzomat compatible taxonomy)
         * (?) Discuss: add tonal centers/local tonality to the annotation
         * put all information to JSON (eliminate csv file(s)).
      * Think, if more titles could be added without significant efforts
        in order to annotate everything from Smithsonian until certain year.
        Thus we will not introduce bias to the balanced dataset
        and could present it as source of musicological information about jazz “until certain year”.
      * Discuss anf implements guidelines to segmentation.
        What should be a smallest segmentation element? So far: chorus (?may be use parts - e.g. A1, A2,...)
        Are there any part taxonomy (e.g. "intro", "break")?.
        E.g. see:
        https://github.com/DDMAL/salami-data-public/blob/master/funct_vocab_dictionary.txt
        http://pythonhosted.org/jams/namespace.html (segment part, segment function)
   * Jazzomat integration
      * Automatically comapre accuracy of chords and beat tracking
        with our annotations (on co-occured tracks). Discuss.
      * Sonify (are beats and chords are subjectively relevant?)
      * Obtain audio for the whole jazzomat dataset
      * Convert annotations
      * Write to jazzomat guys, asking for their annotation methodology on:
         * chords
         * style, rhythmic feel, tonality type (how they devised these taxonomies?!)

0. Title

1. Abstract

2. Introduction

3. Research goals and paper outline

4. Related work.
    Review related datasets and formats:
       I. chord-annotated audio datasets
       II. jazz-related datasets
       III. annotation formats (introduce JAMS)
    Aspects to review:
        - content selection principle
          E.g. from [Humphrey, E. J., & Bello, J. (2015). Four Timely Insights on Automatic Chord Estimation. Retrieved from https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/four-timely-insights-on-automatic-chord-estimation]
          "chords may not be a valid way to describe all kinds of music"
          therefore we select jazz styles where chords are important
          (as both: expression method and contract)
        - annotation guidelines/methodology
        - format
        - what is intended/used for (e.g. chord recognition systems training/testing,
          corpus-based methodology).
    Aspects (more formal):
       * URL
       * paper/reference
       * genre/representativeness. How tracks were selected.
       * Annotation methodology. How labels were assigned.
       * content (e.g., beats, chords, keys, segmentation...)
       * format
       * usages (MIR chord detection, corpus based research)
       * open audio (no)

5. Proposed dataset
   ? Why another one dataset:aspects?
   ? Why another one format: format description?
   NOTE: chord notation semantics (use ISMIR format, but different meaning).
   Unordered aspects:
       * selection (why Smithsonian)
       * ??? failed to have open audio dataset.
         ??? should we include "in search of 'open source' jazz" notes? at least prepare
       * transcription methodology
         (beat tracking, using sources, using visual clues from NNLS chroma,
         background track generation).
         ... accompanying by chroma features and visualization.
   "Site": 2-grams, N-grams, chroma hexagrams, what does they mean and illustrate.
....
Conclusions
....

ATTIC (unordered ideas)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a review of possible approaches to jazz dataset building and  Smithsonian collection advocacy
   review of alternatives:
      "Jazz Standards" book
      Levin's book
      Jazzomat dataset
      Aebersold
      generating data with Band-in-a-Box
      "open source": jamendo, ...
   references to musicologist books/papers which use Smithsonian
   review on how it was built.
   similarities/differences to rockcorpus and billboard.
   criticism of datasets used for seventh-chords recognition by others (coursera, guitar books)
